    <p>Concentration, also known as Match Match, Memory, Pelmanism, Shinkei-suijaku, Pexeso or simply Pairs, is a card game in which all of the cards are laid face down on a surface and two cards are flipped face up over each turn. The object of the game is to turn over pairs of matching cards.</p>

    <p>It is a connection to my childhood. Memory, casually, was a game I played with my father when I was a kid. Many years later, no longer living in Puerto Rico, I found a game of memory with images of Frank Lloyd Wright's window designs. Having studied architecture and appreciating FLW's modernist aesthetic, I found myself in a very interesting time warp of my recent past and my childhood formative years. Designing this game for you has been a pleasure of mine and an invitation to get to know my roots.</p>
